            The Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle originally invented in 1974[2][3] by Hungarian sculptor and
            professor of
            architecture Ernő Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube,[4] the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by
            Pentangle
            Puzzles in the UK in 1978,[5] and then by Ideal Toy Corp in 1980[6] via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven
            Towns founder
            Tom Kremer.[7] The cube was released internationally in 1980 and became one of the most recognized icons in
            popular
            culture. It won the 1980 German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle. As of March 2021, over 450
            million cubes
            had been sold worldwide,[8][9][needs update] making it the world's bestselling puzzle game[10][11] and
            bestselling
            toy.[12] The Rubik's Cube was inducted into the US National Toy Hall of Fame in 2014.[13]
